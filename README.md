# Valuable Practice, but Not a True Achievement
This project was heavily guided by "Boot.dev" and may have been largely completed with their assistance. It was a valuable opportunity to practice using VSCode, Git, and Python syntax. However, I can’t take full credit for creating it, as I relied heavily on copying and pasting. Moving forward, I’ll strive to better understand the code structure, math, and documentation for the libraries used.
